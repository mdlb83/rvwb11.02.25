- Comprehensive test suite (47 tests passing)
- App icons and splash screens configured
- EAS build configuration ready for production

✅ **Completed Today (November 9, 2025):**
- Expanded test coverage (47 tests passing)
- Added error handling, empty states, and loading states
- Created app icons and splash screens
- Configured EAS Build for iOS and Android
- Set up Google Maps API keys as EAS secrets
- Created comprehensive app store preparation documentation
- Fixed build configuration issues

⏳ **Remaining:**
- List view with search and filter functionality (optional)
- Final app store submission
- Production builds and deployment

## Data Source

**Source:** "RVing with Bikes - A Guide to Campgrounds with Full and Partial Hook Ups with Easy Access to Paved Bike Trails"  
**Author:** Betty Chambers  
**Copyright:** © 2022 www.RVingwithBikes.com

### Database Statistics
- **Total Campgrounds:** 385
  - Full hookups: 265 (68.8%)
  - Partial hookups: 120 (31.2%)
- **States Covered:** All 50 US states
- **Data Points:** Each campground includes:
  - Name, type, description
  - City, state, coordinates (latitude/longitude)
  - Hookup type (full/partial)
  - Associated bike trails with descriptions
  - Contributor information (20 community-submitted locations)
  - Embedded HTML links to campground and trail websites

## Implementation Details

### Map View
- Centers on United States by default (lat: 39.8283, lng: -98.5795)
- Displays all 385+ campground markers
- Color-coded markers (green = full hookup, orange = partial hookup)
- User location support (requires permissions)
- Smooth panning and zooming

### Bottom Sheet Drawer
- **Implementation:** Always mounted component controlled by `index` prop
- **Snap Points:** 25% (peek), 50% (default), 90% (expanded)
- **Gestures:**
  - Swipe down to close
  - Tap backdrop to close
  - Swipe up to expand
- **Content Display:**
  - Campground name, location, hookup type badge
  - Full campground information with clickable links
  - Associated bike trails with details
  - Contributor attribution (if applicable)
  - "Get Directions" button

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Bottom Sheet Approach:** Chose "always mount" (Option 1) over conditional rendering to:
   - Avoid mount/unmount timing issues
   - Ensure smooth animations
   - Keep refs stable

2. **Version Compatibility:** 
   - Upgraded to `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` v5.2.6 for Reanimated v4 compatibility
   - Properly configured Babel with reanimated plugin last

3. **Data Handling:**
   - Added null checks throughout for missing campground data
   - Filter out invalid entries before rendering markers
   - Graceful fallbacks for missing information

## Configuration

### Google Maps API Keys
**Status:** ⚠️ **REQUIRED** - Placeholder keys in `app.json`
- Need to add iOS API key: `app.json` → `ios.config.googleMapsApiKey`
- Need to add Android API key: `app.json` → `android.config.googleMaps.apiKey`

### Environment Setup
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

### Testing
```bash
npm test
```

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Add Google Maps API Keys**
   - Get keys from Google Cloud Console
   - Add to `app.json` for iOS and Android
   - Test map functionality on physical devices

2. **List View Screen**
   - Create list view with searchable campground list
   - Implement filters (state, hookup type)
   - Add navigation between map and list views

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up Jest configuration
   - Write tests for data utilities and hooks
   - Add component tests for key UI elements
   - Set up GitHub Actions CI

4. **Polish & Optimization**
   - Add loading states and error handling
   - Optimize map marker clustering (if needed for performance)
   - Add empty states for search/filter results
   - Improve styling and animations

5. **App Store Preparation**
   - Configure EAS Build for production
   - Add app icons and splash screens
   - Set up app store metadata
   - Test on physical iOS and Android devices

## Known Issues & Solutions

### ✅ Resolved
- **Bottom sheet initialization errors:** Fixed by upgrading to v5.2.6 and proper Babel config
- **Null campground data crashes:** Added comprehensive null checks and filtering
- **Reanimated worklet errors:** Fixed by proper Babel plugin ordering and gesture-handler import

### ⚠️ To Address
- Google Maps API keys need to be configured for maps to work
- Some campground entries may have missing/null data (currently filtered out)

### 🔄 Enhancement Needed
- **Keyboard dismissal on map touch**: After searching, when user touches the map, the keyboard should automatically dismiss to improve UX

## Development Notes

### Important Commands
```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Clear cache and restart
npm start -- --clear

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
eas build --platform ios --profile production
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

### File Organization Principles
- Components organized by feature (map, campground, filters)
- Custom hooks for data management
- Type definitions centralized in `types/`
- Utilities for data processing in `utils/`
- Following React Native and Expo best practices
